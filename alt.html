    <h1>hi</h1>
    <p>tldr thing:
    <br><br>
    The content posted on @kirfx0 is much less "filtered" than on my main, and in general you'll see much more venting than usual on this acc compared to main. If you aren't okay with seeing some of that stuff, then don't follow, and don't worry about it, half the reason this page and account exists is so that people don't have to see any of "this stuff" on the tls if they don't want to

    oh yeah i kinda just randomly follow whoever i feel like following on here in the moment, usually people which are chill and don't fill my tl with the negativity typical of some communities I'm involved in.
    <br><br><br>
    TLDR THING OVER
    <br><br><br><br><br>
    <!-- (continuing about followers in the next paragraph, full page currently isn't finished so i wouldn't read this yet. gonna add more here but for now the pinned thread [which is only accessible to followers, part of why I'm switching to using a page on here] still plays the part which is still important even with this page on here)
    <br><br><br>
    On main i kinda just follow people who seem decent enough upon looking at their profile for 30 seconds or make something which i think is cool or whatever, some of which people get involved in drama or whatever and honestly i just can't be bothered with it. I usually never actually involve myself in any or much of the discussion around that kind of thing be cause once again, i just can't be bothered with it and it's not worth my time. I still follow those who do over there and i kinda just deal with the shit on my tl or ignore it or whatever but on here i just don't want to see it, i want to be able to get away from that stuff when i want to. I have no hard feelings towards those i follow on main, i just wanna avoid some of the stuff i hear on there sometimes. My mental state already isn't the greatest, and i don't think seeing said stuff all the time does any favours on that front.
