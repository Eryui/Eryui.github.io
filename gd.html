    <p>I'm gonna sorta half use this as a little archive for what i make in the game.<br>you don't often see all the ditched projects or just random little things that never come anywhere close to being finished and released as a full level, and with me being someone who's not been able to fully finish a gd project in the past few years i never really end up showing most of what i actually make in the game, so i wanna use this page as a place to put that stuff (along with the occasional finished project whenever they start actually becoming a thing)</p>
